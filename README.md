# MA308 Statistical Computation and Software
This repository contains the final project of the Statistical Computation and Software course opened by Southern University of Science and Technology in 2020Fall.

*Used R to do a missing value detection and data processing, performed the data visualization by ggplot2 packets, computed the correlation matrix, and observed their distribution and other properties*

*Based on several factors, built a general linear model to evaluate the probability of diagnosis, used stepwise to delete some non- significant variables, drew a Q-Q plot and residual plot to analyze outliers and high leverage points, and combined ANOVA and dispersion test*

*Fixed the data with some machine learning techniques, calculated the confusion matrix and ROC, and selected the best model to make a probability prediction*
